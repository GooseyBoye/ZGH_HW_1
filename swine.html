        Feral swines, also knows as wild hogs, are an invasive species in the United States. 
        They cause massive havoc to a variety of things, such as agriculture, posing a danger to people and property.
        Feral swines can damage crops by either eating them or by stomping over their roots, although they target specific crops, such as soy beans, they can virtually eat any crop.
        Swines are also known to carry many viruses, which can endanger the lives of pets as well as their owners.
