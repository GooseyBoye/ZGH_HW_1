        The Nile Crocodile is an invasive species in the FLorida Everglades.
        Researchers are unsure of how they were able to arrive all the way from their native environment of Africa, with some speculation of them being here due to unlincensed reptile collectors.
        A male nile crocodile can be up to more than 16 feet long and weight nearly a ton. 
        They are also extremely aggressive, far more than the standard American crocodile or alligator.
