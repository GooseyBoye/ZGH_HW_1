        Invasive carp consists of four species of carp fish: Black carp, Grass carp, Bighead carp and silver carp.
        originally brough to the US in order to control algae in wastewater treatment plants and pods, alongside for eating. 
        They have no natural predators in the United States, this mixed with the fact they can survive for decades and lay many eggs,
        they are able to drive out other fish and lower water quality, which can have detrimental effects in the ecosystem.
